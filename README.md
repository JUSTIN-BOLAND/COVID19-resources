# How to contribute

The best way to contribute is to make a pull request. Here's how: 

1. Click on the edit button on the top right corner of the README.md
2. Make your changes to the resources: follow the [template](#templates) for how to add resources in the right section. You might also want to refer to the [guide on markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) which tells you how to use formatting. This will make it much easier for people to find the resources they need. You can also click on *Preview changes* tab to see how your changes will look.  
3. Make a simple (maybe less than 5 words) commit message in the *Commit changes* section and an optional description below that. 
4. Ensure you pick the **Create a new branch** option below! 
5. Then click on *Propose file change*. This leads you to the *Open a pull request* page. 
6. The title of your pull request is automatically the name of the change you proposed in the previous page. You can change it; write more description; or cancel. 
7. Once you're done writing, click on *Create pull request*.
